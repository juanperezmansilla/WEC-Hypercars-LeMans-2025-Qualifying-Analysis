# WEC Hypercars - 24h Le Mans 2025: Qualifying Performance Analysis & Lap Prediction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding the intricate dynamics of **WEC Hypercars** during the **Qualify Hyperpole 1 and Hyperpole 2 sessions** at the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans 2025. It integrates advanced data analysis, machine learning techniques, and a practical Shiny application to provide multi-faceted insights into qualifying performance and driver behavior in pursuit of the fastest lap.

## Project Overview

The Hyperpole sessions at Le Mans are the pinnacle of raw speed, where every millisecond counts to secure the best grid position. This project delves deep into the data generated by **WEC Hypercars** exclusively during the 2025 qualifying sessions. By combining rigorous statistical analysis with predictive machine learning models, we explore various facets of performance, from individual lap dynamics to driver strategies for extracting maximum pace. Furthermore, a user-friendly Shiny application is included to provide real-time fast lap prediction capabilities, enhancing the practical utility of our findings.

## Analysis: Deconstructing Le Mans Qualifying Performance

The **`Analysis WEC Hypercars - 24h Le Mans 2025.html`** file presents an extensive analytical deep dive into the qualifying session data. This section focuses on a systematic examination of various performance indicators, designed to reveal patterns and crucial insights into how Hypercars perform during a high-pressure qualifying attempt.

A key initial step in the analysis involved **thorough data cleaning**. This crucial process ensured the accuracy and reliability of the raw data sourced from the FIA WEC Al Kamel Systems website, preparing it for meaningful interpretation.

Following the data cleaning, a detailed examination of various performance indicators was performed through a series of insightful visualizations:

* **Lap Time Distributions:** A thorough investigation into the spread and consistency of lap times achieved by various **Hypercars and drivers** during the Hyperpole sessions. This helps in understanding overall pace and maximum performance capability.
* **Sector-Specific Performance:** A detailed breakdown of vehicle performance across the three distinct sectors of the Le Mans circuit. This analysis highlights where cars gain or lose time and identifies crucial segments for performance optimization, with charts displayed by **sector times**, **manufacturer**, and **driver**.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Comparisons between different teams and manufacturers, shedding light on their unique strengths and weaknesses during the qualifying sessions.

This meticulous analysis provides a foundational understanding of the raw performance data, paving the way for more advanced modeling.

## Machine Learning: Unveiling Driving Styles & Lap Prediction

The **`ML WEC Hypercars - 24h Le Mans 2025.html`** file contains the details of a machine learning approach aimed at identifying and categorizing distinct driving styles among the WEC Hypercar drivers, and predicting lap performance.

The machine learning efforts focused on several key areas:

* **Sector Importance (Correlation Analysis):** An **analysis of sector importance** was conducted by examining the correlations between performance in different sectors and overall lap times. This step helps to understand which sectors have the most significant impact on a driver's final lap time.
* **Binary Lap Time Improvement Prediction:** A **binary classification model** was developed to predict whether a given lap would result in an improved lap time or not, based on various influential factors. This predictive model helps in understanding the conditions and driver inputs that lead to faster laps.
* **Driving Style Clustering:** Utilizing unsupervised learning techniques, specifically **clustering algorithms**, the objective was to **identify natural driver groupings** who exhibit similar performance profiles across different sectors of the track. This effort moves beyond raw lap times to understand *how* drivers achieve their performance, characterizing their general traits, such as tendencies to be aggressive in certain sectors or conservative in others.

This unsupervised learning effort offers a unique perspective on driver strategy and execution in qualifying sessions.

## Shiny Application: Fast Lap Predictor

Included in this project is an **interactive Shiny application** designed to predict whether a given lap will be a "fast lap" based on specific input parameters. This application leverages the insights gained from the analysis and machine learning models to provide a practical tool for real-time decision-making or post-qualifying strategy evaluation.

The Shiny app allows users to:

* **Input Qualifying Parameters:** Provide hypothetical or real-time data points related to a lap.
* **Receive Instant Predictions:** Get an immediate prediction on the likelihood of the lap being classified as a "fast lap."
* **Visualize Influencing Factors:** Potentially see which parameters are most heavily influencing the prediction, offering a transparent view of the model's decision-making process.

This predictive tool can be invaluable for understanding the conditions and driving characteristics that typically lead to optimal lap times in Le Mans qualifying sessions.
